git = basically it  track the change and save that work (tracking mechanism)
repo = it a folder which work as a container to store the work 

1. to make a new repo -
    1. go to file 
    2. create new file,give name and description
    3. create it

2. now u can see changes on git if u do work in that repo folder 

3. if u do changes u can give commit so that later u know what changes has been done by u or someone other

    Writing good commit message is a skill. Let's understand this.
    feat - a new feature
    fix - a bug fix
    docs - changes in documentation
    style - everything related to styling
    refactor - code changes that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
    test - everything related to testing
    chore - updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc

    Use this to start the message. Like if we added a test for a function that checks leap year, we start with test. Then in short describe the work we did

    test: add unit test for leapYearCheck()

4. publish at github ( git is on ur own machine and  github basically now u can access it from deferent device also )
